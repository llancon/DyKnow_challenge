# DyKnow_challenge

I started by installing all the dependencies, to see what development environment I had to work with. I got familiar with what the app is supposed to do. After I had an idea of what the app does, I started to build the wire frame. First I added Html section by section. I also added Bootstrap to speed of the process. When I got to the chart part. I used Google charts to added in the last parts. I added in the Javascript that is already included and modified it to match the DyKnow challenge version.

The things I did not accomplish: I didn't make an Ajax call to the API that would be supplying the continuous stream of live information. I also didn't format the HTML and CSS to match to perfection the wireframe that was provided. I didn't rework the Javascript in the chart and table so that I didn't have to hard code twice.

Through this exercise, I was able to learn about how the app works and how it is organized.
